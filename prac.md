## NOTES:
When incorporating the Camera module it is important to note that
There may be a port error and this is due to the fact that there is no camera.close()

Also NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE SECTION OF THE CLIENT SCRIPT THAT WE SEE THAT WE CAN JUST VIEW THE IMAGE STRAIGHT ON...


QUICK FIX: LOAD IN WINDTUNNEL SCRIPT SO THEY CAN JUST RUN THAT...AND THAT WAY THEY CAN SEE A STILL IMAGE...

CLIENT CAN ONLY SEND A SINGLE IMAGE BEFORE DISCONNECTING...WILL BE BUILDING OFF OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY IN ORDER TO HAVE CAPABILITES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE WITH THE WINDTUNNEL SCRIPT...
